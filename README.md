# CSR
Consensus Clustering for Subclonal structure Reconstruction
## Introduction
CSR was originally created for Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genome (PCAWG) working group, Heterogeneity and Evolution, of International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) during the Heterogeneity project. It was used to make a consensus subclonal architecture out of results of 11 participating methods. Please see (Heterogeneity citation) for details.
## Prerequisitions
Part of the calculation depends on SPAMS http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html. Please follow the instructions on their website to install spams python3 version (prefer Anaconda distribution).
## Installing
